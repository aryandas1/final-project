    "Barry Bonds is an American former professional baseball player who played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He is widely considered to be one of the greatest baseball players of all time. Bonds was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates (1986-1992) and the San Francisco Giants (1993-2007). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pittsburgh Pirates selected Bonds with the sixth overall pick in the 1985 Major League Baseball draft, and he spent 1986-1992 with the Pirates. In his six years with the Pirates, Bonds won two Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards and had already established himself as one of the best players in the league. In 1993, Bonds left the Pirates to sign a lucrative free agent contract with the San Francisco Giants. The Giants are the same team his father, Bobby Bonds, played for as well as Bonds' godfather, Willie Mays. At the time, this deal was the largest in baseball history. With the Giants, Bonds would go on to win another five MVPs. In his career, along with his ridiculous seven total NL MVP awards, Bonds earned a cumulative 12 Silver Slugger awards, eight Gold Glove awards, 14 All-Star selections, led MLB in on-base plus slugging (OPS), was a top five hitter in 12 of his 17 qualifying seasons, and break a number of all-time career records, including all-time home runs (762), single season home runs (73), and all-time walks. Additionally, Bonds ranks second in career Wins Above Replacement (WAR) among all major league players, behind Babe Ruth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above information, any person with reasonable cognitive abilities would consider Barry Bonds as a candidate for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, right? Well, despite Bonds' accolades, he actually led a controversial career, most notably as the central figure in the MLB steroid scandal. During the time when Bonds played, there were a number of players using steroids, which is why this era when Bonds played is literally called the \"steroid era\" of baseball. Between 1998 and 2009, 10 players reached 500 career home runs, and of the 10 players, six (Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Mark McGwire, Manny Ramirez, Rafael Palmeiro and Gary Sheffield) have all been linked to steroids or some sort of performance enhacing drug (PED). The story behind the Barry Bonds steroid scandal is covered extensively in a book written by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, reporters for the San Francisco Chronicle, called *Game of Shadows*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just this past year, in his final year on the hall of fame ballot, Bonds failed yet again to reach the 75% of the votes needed to be inducted. This means that officially, Barry Bonds is not a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and never will be. \n",
    "\n",
    "What do I want to want to show? Good question. I want to show you that **Barry Bonds, if you take out the years where he was using steroids, is still a player that deserves to be a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.**"

    "I briefly touched upon how distinguished Barry Bonds is as a player as a whole, but I want to focus specifically on his pre steroid (I will refer to this period at time throughout as the 'pre-juice' period) career. Bonds is reported to have started using steroid in 1998, but did not really see the affects for about a year, so we will consider the pre-juice period every year from his rookie year up until 1998 (inclusive). Up to 1998, here is what Bonds had accomplished:\n",

    "The first tool I want to look at it and compare is how did Bonds' hitting compare to other hall of famers. We can start by looking at contact hitting. Contact hitting is not only hitting for power and maximizing the amount of runs scored, but also limiting the amount of times you strikeout and maximizing the amount of times you put the ball in play, result in a high batting average. A good way to compare Barry Bonds batting average to other hall of famers is with a scatter plot. We want to use batting average as a barometer as opposed to something like total hits in a career because everyone played for differing amounts of time, and with Bonds' case, we are only using his clean seasons to prove a point. Our goal here is to be as close to the regression line as possible, which shows what the average hall of famer had as a batting average."

    "Upon plotting the residuals in a scatter plot, we see that Barry Bonds is about as expected. There are certainly players that were better contact hitters than Bonds, and there are a few outliers marked in green, but Bonds is certainly not a bad contact hitter. Relative to other hall of fame players, Barry Bonds is about an average contact hitter."

    "Another tool we can look at is power hitting compared to other hall of famers. We can use a similar method as above and check for ratios as opposed to totals. Power hitting is generally determined by the amount of extra base hits a player has, which include doubles, triples, and home runs. However, our dataframe gives us the number of hits a player has, but not if they scored a double/triple/homerun. They do give us the number of doubles/triples/homeruns they scored, so to calculate the number of singles, we subtract the number of doubles/triples/homeruns from the number of hits. We then take doubles/triples/homeruns and multiply them by 2/3/4 respectively. This will allow us to accurately see which players were the best at hitting for power in the hall of fame.\n",

    "I want to create a new column for singles and a new column for total bases. Both of which can be derived from the doubles, triples, and home runs columns. Total bases also includes walks so I can also include BB and HBP columns in this calculation."

    "Barry Bonds' power hitting is arguably one of the best in the dataset, and the dataset is full of quite literally the greatest baseball players of all time. This translates as saying then that Barry Bonds, before using steroids, is one of the greatest power hitters of all time. His total bases residual is a staggering 854 above the expected total bases, which is simply obnoxious how good that is. Bonds is far above the regression line, and while there are a few players who are well above Barry Bonds in terms of power hitting, Bonds is better than the majority of current hall of famers. While this can partially be attributed to the low amount of at bats in his career compared to other hall of famers, even if he regressed in his second half of his career in a world where he theoretically was not using steroids, I can't imagine he regresses to the point where he would fall too far down the chart of all time power hitters. Even if he regressed to the mean, that would still make him a surefire selection for the hall of fame if he since the mean he will regress to is the mean of hall of famers, which is not any ordinary set of players.

    "Another way to compare Bonds to the field of hall of famers is by comparing their fielding stats. Due to the difference in playmaking opportunities between infielders and outfielders, I will only compare Bonds with other outfielders since Bonds played in the outfield his entire career. To do this, I first filter out any player that did not play in the outfield, then I calculate the total outs that each Hall of Famer was responsible for by combining each player's putouts (outs he was physically responsible for) with assists (times he aided in getting the out). We also create another column for fielding percentage, which represents the percentage of times a player recorded an out when he was given a chance (Outs/Outs+Errors)."

    "After analyzing and comparing Barry Bonds to other current hall of famers with four of the most important tools that make up any baseball player, it is obvious that the results put him up there as a qualified candidate for the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Bonds has exceptional statistics to support a bid for the hall of fame and his work on the field is excellent support for it. He out-performs other hall of famers by a wide margin in power hitting and in speed, and performs as well as the rest of the hall of famers in contact hitting and in fielding. \n",
    "\n",
    "For contact hitting, I determined the batting average of everyone in the dataset, plotted everyone on a scatter plot, and ran a regression line and found that Bonds is about average. \n",
    "\n",
    "With power hitting, I created a new column in our dataframe called total bases which rewarded bigger hits (Ex. HR is more valuable than double). I saw that Barry Bonds significantly out performed other hall of famers. Simply put, Barry Bonds was one of the best at hitting the ball really far consistently, even without steroids. I used the same analysis methods I used for contact hitting evaluation here too. \n",
    "\n",
    "For fielding, I made a new column for total out a player was responsible for and plotted that. I found that infielders and outfielders have numbers that you can not really compare so I excluded infielders from this dataset. There were a small amount of outfielders in this dataset, and there were a few that were outliers, far exceeding the mean. Most of the players were clustered together, Bonds among them. The outliers may have been where they were because either the game was different in their era, or they may have even switched positions from infield to outfield, which can skew numbers. In summary, this analysis showed us Bonds was a good fielder that performed about as well as other hall of famers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I thought measuring speed was possible through evaluating stolen bases and baserunning as a whole. Upon creating plots similar to the previous categories, it was apparent that Bonds was one of the greatest baserunners ever, at least among the hall of famers. He far exceeded the expected number and outperformed much of the field, similar to how he outperformed much of the field in power hitting. \n",

    "Quantifiably, Barry Bonds before using steroids was on well on his way to becoming a surefire future hall of fame player, and his career up until that point can certainly make a case for having a place in the hall of fame."

    "Barry Bonds will go down as one of the greatest baseball players of all time. The trajectory of Bonds' career had he not used steroids is possibly one of the biggest mysteries in sports, but most fans and players agree that he certainly would have earned a place in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Unfortunately, his steroid use has ultimately tainted his career and most of his accolades, but I believe the hall of fame voters failed to understand that even before he used steroids, Bonds was already a hall of famer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the application of the Data Science Pipeline, I hope it is evident why Barry Bonds deserves a place in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Bonds' pre-juice career alone absolutely has a case to make the MLB Hall of Fame, and had he even produced at a fraction of the rate of his juiced and steroid-filled latter half of his career, he easily would have made it in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of the statistics, Bonds was known to have not been the best teammate and not the best clubhouse guy. He also had a dicy relationship with the media and with fans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics through each facet of baseball do not tell the full story of Barry Bonds, but the stats do say a lot. It says that he was one of the best players ever and he was not elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame for reasons outside of his production on the field."
